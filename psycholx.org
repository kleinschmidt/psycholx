#+TITLE: Grad psycholinguistics

* topics/theme
  I think the overall theme is going to be variability vs. structure.  How much
  do these affect processing?  How are they each represented?  What are the
  computational demands they each pose?

  Then there are the "classic" debates in psycholx: parsing wars, interactive
  activation vs. feedforward, prediction.

** exemplar models

** availability vs. info theory models (production) 

** stability vs. plasticity

** parsing wars: structure or content?

** methods
   eye tracking, corpus, psychophysics, self-paced reading, computational
   modeling

** acquisition (related to stability/plasticity?)

** what information is used when 
   modularity vs. interaction.  perspective taking.  socio stuff.  prediction
   vs. integration.
